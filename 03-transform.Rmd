# Transform {#transform}

## **Introduction    **
Transforming cleaned data to create summaries and aggregations is an common part of the data analysis process along with extracting out data to create new features. With SQL-like commands you can answer numerous questions in the exploratory phase of a analysis prior to building a model with `dplyr`. 

### **dplyr   **

[`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html): A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory.

#### **Examples **

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(insuranceData)
library(magrittr)
data("AutoBi")

# summary of loss by whether or not the claimant was wearing a seatbelt/child restraint

AutoBi %>% group_by(SEATBELT, MARITAL) %>% 
           summarise(mLOSS = median(LOSS))


```
