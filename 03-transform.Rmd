# Transform {#transform}

Transforming cleaned data to create summaries is an important part of the data analysis process along with extracting out features to create new features in variable.


* [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html): A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects, both in memory and out of memory.

**Examples: **

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(insuranceData)
library(magrittr)
data("AutoBi")

# summary of loss by whether or not the claimant was wearing a seatbelt/child restraint

AutoBi %>% group_by(SEATBELT, MARITAL) %>% 
           summarise(mLOSS = median(LOSS))


```
