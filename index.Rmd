# Welcome

Welcome to the guidebook **R for FinTech**! This guidebook will include examples, tutorials, and highlight essential R packages for Data Science. The organization of this guide is inspired by the book [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) from Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham which explores each step of the data science process from acquiring data to communicating the outputs. This guidebook has emphasis on ["FinTech"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) or Financial Technology applications in data analysis.
